<H1 style='color:yellow'>Quotes of Dev - Project 5</H1>

<H2 style='color:yellow'>Brief Description:</H2>

This is a website that that manages quotes that are related to programming and/or development. The website randomly
displays quotes, and allows the user to select quotes, based on authors, categories, or tags. There is an interface
for adding quotes.

The requirement calls for a fixed-width of 1080px, with mobile, tablet, and desktop responsiveness.

<H2 style='color:yellow'>Technology Used:</H2>

This project uses the following technology:

- Visual Code Studio
- iTerm2
- MAMP
- phpAdmin
- HTML
- PHP
- CSS/SASS (variables, mixins, nesting, and partials)
- Javascript/jQuery
- Yarn
- Gulp
- Google Fonts
- WordPress
  - Advanced Custom Fields
  - All-in-One WP Migration

<H2 style='color:yellow'>Personal Learnings:</H2>

- Learned how to pull data from and push data to WordPress, using the WP Rest API. Super-happy about that!
- Learned more about how WP manages post objects, and how WP functions can be used to retrieve elements of the object.
- Looking back on the past few projects that used WP. I can clearly see now how WP uses a hierarchy to determine what
  templates get loaded, and how we can interact with WP, using HTML, PHP, Javascript/Jquery, etc.

<H2 style='color:yellow'>Stretch Goals:</H2>

- Unlike the specification website (https://quotes.academy.red/), on the archive page, the authors were sorted, and the duplicate authors were removed. The categories and tags were sorted too.

- I added animation to the Submit Quote Form.

<H2 style='color:yellow'>Install Information:</H2>

Simply install all of the available files and folders in your root folder, using the folloing folder structure.

- wp-admin
- wp-content
- wp-includes
- .htaccess (hidden file)
